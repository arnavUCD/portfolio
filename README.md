# portfolio
This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my academic and personal projects developed throughout my educational journey. Each folder within this repository represents a distinct project, ranging from coursework assignments and independent learning exercises to larger, self-initiated applications. The projects span multiple programming languages, frameworks, and domainsâ€”including software development, data structures, algorithms, and more.

My goal with this portfolio is to demonstrate the breadth and depth of my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and commitment to continuous learning. Each project is organized with clear documentation to explain its purpose, features, and implementation details. Where applicable, you will also find instructions for running or compiling the code, as well as reflections on challenges encountered and lessons learned.

This repository is intended for internship applications, networking, and personal growth. I welcome feedback, suggestions, and collaboration opportunities. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.
